# LazSamples

This is a collection of short Lazarus projects covering several aspects of programming
* Extract text from html
* Drag-and-drop to/in a DBGrid
* Gaussian fit
* Image manipulation with FpImage
* and more...

Most of this code is taken from my answers to user questions in the Lazarus forum (https://forum.lazarus.freepascal.org/index.php)
